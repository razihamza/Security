I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

## Portfolio

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my journey to earn the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. This program has provided insights into:
* Programming for cybersecurity tasks
* Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
* SIEM tools for cybersecurity

* Performing packet capture and analysis

Additionally, it has paved the way for me to pursue one of the entry-level following roles:
