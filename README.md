# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio, a collection of hands-on projects, tasks, and certifications completed during my journey through the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)**.

These programs helped me gain practical experience in:
- Cybersecurity fundamentals and risk management
- Programming and scripting for security tasks
- Network and system security
- Using SIEM tools and intrusion detection systems
- Packet capture, analysis, and incident response

I'm actively pursuing entry-level roles such as:
- Cybersecurity Analyst  
- Security Analyst  
- SOC Analyst  
- Information Security Analyst  
- IT Security Analyst  
- Cyber Defense Analyst
